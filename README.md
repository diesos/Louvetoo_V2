# Meme Generator

## Overview

This project is designed to enhance my React knowledge by creating a web application that allows users to generate memes randomly. Users can add top text and bottom text to the memes.

## Features

- Generate random memes
- Fetch meme data from a meme API
- Add custom top text and bottom text to memes

## How It Works

1. Each time the user presses the "Random" button, the app fetches data from a meme API.
2. The user can then add a top text and a bottom text to the generated meme.

## Installation
